# Dynamic-Square-Interaction
Explore an interactive grid of dynamic squares created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each square responds to different user interactions like mouse enter, mouse leave, and double click by changing colors, displaying random numbers, and more. The project demonstrates the use of JavaScript event listeners to create engaging visual effects.
